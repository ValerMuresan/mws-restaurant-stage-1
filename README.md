## Project description

For the **Restaurant Reviews** project, a static webpage must to be converted into a mobile-ready web application. The code must be updated to be responsive on different sized displays and also for offline experience is mandatory a service worker to be added.


## Download and setting locally

1. Download/Clone the project from [Github](https://github.com/ValerMuresan/mws-restaurant-stage-1.git).

2. Setting locally:

* In project folder, start up a simple HTTP server to serve up the site files on your local computer. Python has some simple tools to do this, and you don't even need to know Python. For most people, it's already installed on your computer.
* In a terminal, check the version of Python you have: `python -V`. If you have Python 2.x, spin up the server with `python -m SimpleHTTPServer 5000` (or some other port, if port 5000 is already in use.) For Python 3.x, you can use `python3 -m http.server 5000`. If you don't have Python installed, navigate to Python's [website](https://www.python.org/) to download and install the software.
* With your server running, visit the site: `http://localhost:5000`.
